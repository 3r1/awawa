![image previewing poe2_item_filter](/preview_v2.png)

awawa lite filter is a lightweight PoE2 highlight filter that makes awawa noises on item drops and is color-themed around Jelly Hoshiumi's palette.
It should serve you well for the entire game, unless you desire to hide certain loot.

Features:
- highlight for all the important stuff
- socket & quality highlighting
- awawa sounds (&maybe some screaming)

## Filterblade module
There is now a filterblade awawa module. It is probable that the module will be updated and this repo will become outdated.

Simply click modules under strictness and search "awawa" in the Public tab. Alternatively, use this module link and then choose your own strictness: https://www.filterblade.xyz/?profile=Elaroz&saveState=AJ22P5YRFGTS2K&isPreset=true&game=Poe2&preview=true

![image previewing poe2_item_filter](/preview_v2.png)

awawa lite filter is a lightweight PoE2 highlight filter that makes awawa noises on item drops and is color-themed around Jelly Hoshiumi's palette.

Features:
- highlight for all the important stuff
- socket & quality highlighting
- awawa sounds (&maybe some screaming)

## Install
Grab the latest release from https://github.com/3r1/awawa/releases

win: extract files into Poe2 game Documents folder

`Documents\My Games\Path of Exile 2`

linux: places files in wineprefix of steamlibrary containing poe2 location

`Steam/steamapps/compatdata/2694490/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/My Games/Path of Exile 2`

## Todo
- work on color palette and make it less blue-heavy
- add more endgame rules in the future
